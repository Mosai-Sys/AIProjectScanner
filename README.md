# AIProjectScanner
A simple tool (PowerShell and Python versions) that scans a directory (and all its subdirectories) and exports the full structure into a single structured JSON file. The goal is to provide AI-friendly project representations, including metadata about large or binary files, without dumping huge amounts of raw data.
